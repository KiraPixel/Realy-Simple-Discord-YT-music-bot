# Discord Bot Readme

This repository contains a Discord bot that requires the following libraries and tools to function properly:

- **PyNaCl (nacl)**: A Python binding to the Networking and Cryptography (NaCl) library. It is used for voice-related functionalities in the bot.

- **disnake**: A powerful and flexible Discord API wrapper for Python. It provides an intuitive interface to interact with Discord's API and build feature-rich bots.

- **pytube**: A lightweight library to interact with YouTube. It allows the bot to perform various operations related to YouTube, such as searching for videos, downloading audio or video files, etc.

Additionally, you need to install **FFmpeg** as a requirement for the bot's voice-related features. FFmpeg is a command-line tool for handling multimedia data. You can download FFmpeg from the official website: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
